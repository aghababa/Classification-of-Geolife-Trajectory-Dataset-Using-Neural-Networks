# deep-learning-project

This is the repository for our Deep Learning course in Fall 2020 at University of Utah.

In this project, using neural networks, we will do classification tasks on the Geolife GPS Trajectory Dataset released by Microsoft.

The dataset was collected in Microsoft Research Asia Geolife project by 182 users from April 2007 to August 2012. 
A GPS trajectory of this dataset is represented by a sequence of time-stamped points, 
each of which contains the information of latitude, longitude and altitude. Furthermore, 73 users have labeled 
their trajectories with transportation mode as car, bus, walk or train.
